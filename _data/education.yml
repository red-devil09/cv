    I learnt most of the key skills during my time at Institute that
                I will take through my career such as teamwork and working to
                tight deadlines. There I learnt the essence of healthy
                lifestyle.

     I spend the significant part of my free time as a member of
                *Student's Activity Club* ( responsible for organising
                the annual flagship cultural fest of NIT KKR ) taking on roles
                such as *Event Cordinator* and I am also a member of
                Institute's Security And Anti-Ragging Comittee *SAARC*.
                
    I also volunteered for _Navjyoti India Foundation_ which is an _NGO_ working for the betterment of students of underprivileged section of the society.
